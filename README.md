# Kantaria API
A rewrite of an existing API (Found in /example). [Jira Project](https://blackwood.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?projectKey=KANAPI&rapidView=2)

See draft API Spec at [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q_kc99gjiXMNrBCE19Cy7UNjmqiAzG6_S1WBf62RVxw/edit?usp=sharing)

## Running
To start your own development copy of the api just run `docker-compose up` after installing
[docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) and [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) 
You should now be able to visit `http://localhost:8080`.

It is recommended you use a program like [Postman](http://www.getpostman.com/) to interact with the API.
